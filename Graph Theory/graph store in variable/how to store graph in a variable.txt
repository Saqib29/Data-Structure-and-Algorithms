how graph stores inputed things. There are two common ways....

1. adjacency matrix (large memory)
2. adjacency list (less memory)

"here adjacent means |~next to something~|"

*theer is a noteable thing that, if graph is undirected the matrix become semetric, mat[i][j] == mat[j][i]

* when adjacency matrix is useful?
-> when to chech if there is a edge betwueen u,v node, then it's easy to check in matrix like: matrix[u][v].
   but in case of adjacency list, need use loop to check.
